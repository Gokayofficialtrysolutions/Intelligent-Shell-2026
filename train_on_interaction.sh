# Future steps:
# 1. Preprocess this new data (USER_INPUT, MODEL_OUTPUT) into a suitable format.
# 2. Append to a training dataset (e.g., a JSONL file).
# 3. If enough new data or other criteria met, trigger a fine-tuning run on the merged_model
#    using a script like `accelerate launch train_script.py --model_name_or_path ./merged_model ...`
#    This would require a separate Python training script (e.g., using Hugging Face `transformers.Trainer` or a custom loop).
