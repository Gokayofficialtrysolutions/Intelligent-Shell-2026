# AIDE Sandbox Handoff Notes

## Project: Autonomous AGI Terminal Development

**Date:** 2024-07-15 (Placeholder, actual date of creation)

**Current Branch:** `feature/interactive-agi-v2` (or the branch active when this note is read)

**Current Status of Work:**
The project is currently in **Phase 2: Activating the Merged Model & Basic Parameter Control**, attempting **Step 4: Test Merged Model Interaction & Parameter Control**.

**CRITICAL BLOCKER:**
*   **Insufficient Disk Space in Previous Sandbox:** The primary reason for migrating to this new sandbox is the persistent `[Errno 28] No space left on device` error encountered when attempting to `pip install torch transformers sentencepiece`. These libraries are essential for loading the merged model and proceeding with the project.

**Work Completed in the Current Branch (`feature/interactive-agi-v2`) So Far:**
1.  **`interactive_agi.py` Major Update:**
    *   Implemented the `MergedAGI` class designed to load a Hugging Face model from the `./merged_model` directory.
    *   Includes logic for tokenizer and model loading, device placement (CUDA if available, else CPU), and error handling.
    *   Added runtime parameter control via user commands:
        *   `/set parameter <NAME> <VALUE>` (e.g., MAX_TOKENS, TEMPERATURE)
        *   `/show parameters`
    *   Default generation parameters have been set with a focus on coding tasks.
    *   The script is designed to fall back to `AGIPPlaceholder` (mock responses) if the real model loading fails.
2.  **Core Scripts (`download_models.sh`, `train_on_interaction.sh`, `merge_config.yml`, `README.md`)**: These were established in earlier phases and are present in the branch.

**Assumptions for this New Sandbox:**
*   This new sandbox environment has **sufficient disk space** to successfully install large Python libraries like PyTorch and Transformers.
*   The content of the Git repository (branch `feature/interactive-agi-v2`) has been correctly transferred or is accessible.

**Immediate Next Steps for the AIDE (Jules) in this New Sandbox:**

1.  **Verify User-Created `./merged_model` Directory:**
    *   **USER ACTION REQUIRED:** Please ensure that the `./merged_model` directory, which should have been created by you (the user) by running `download_models.sh` and then `mergekit-yaml merge_config.yml ./merged_model ...` in your local environment, is **present in the root of this project in the new sandbox.**
    *   If it's not automatically preserved or copied, you may need to upload or transfer it into this new sandbox environment. Without `./merged_model`, the AGI cannot test the actual model loading.

2.  **Attempt Dependency Installation:**
    *   The AIDE will run: `pip install torch transformers sentencepiece`
    *   This step needs to succeed without disk space errors.

3.  **Test `interactive_agi.py` Startup & Model Loading:**
    *   If dependency installation is successful, the AIDE will run: `echo "exit" | python interactive_agi.py`
    *   The AIDE will examine the output to:
        *   Confirm that the `TRANSFORMERS_AVAILABLE` flag is true (i.e., libraries imported).
        *   Check if the script attempts to load from `./merged_model`.
        *   See if loading is successful or if it falls back to mock mode (and why).

4.  **Proceed with Full Testing (if model loads):**
    *   If the model loads successfully, the AIDE will continue with interactive testing of prompts and parameter controls as previously planned for Phase 2, Step 4.

5.  **Troubleshooting (if issues persist):**
    *   If model loading fails for reasons other than missing libraries (e.g., issues with `./merged_model` content, code errors), the AIDE will diagnose and attempt to fix them.

**Summary for User:**
1.  Ensure `./merged_model` is in the project root in this new sandbox.
2.  Inform the AIDE (Jules) that the new sandbox is ready and if `./merged_model` has been placed.

The AIDE will then autonomously attempt to install dependencies and test the system.
Thank you!
